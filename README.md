I bought my first computer, a Commodore 64, when I was around 12 years old, around 1985.
First I only got the tape drive, the Commodore 1530 Datasette, but after a year or so I bought the disk drive, a Commodore 1541.
As I remember it, the 1541 costed almost as much as the computer itself, around ten thousand Belgian francs (250 euros).
My 64 was mostly used for gaming but I also wrote my first programs on that computer.

A few years later, I sold my commodore 64 to a classmate to buy an Amiga 500.
Lucky enough I kept some of my floppies and for many years they stayed safe at my mums' house.

Then my friend Frank Sleeuwaert turned up with a Commodore 64 and was so kind to suggest that he could image my old C64 floppies to .D64 files.
Thanks a lot to Frank for all his effort !

One of these floppies, called 'Zelfgemaakte Software 01' ('Selfmade software 01'), contained the BASIC files uploaded in this repository.
They were written around 1986-1987.
Some of these BASIC programs I had copied as a teenager from a magazine ('commodore info jaargang 4'), others were my own creation.

The one that I remember best is 'winkel 1.0.bas'.
This was a program to calculate the sales receipts during the yearly fundraising event of my fathers' club.
My first program to have a real practical use, I was quite proud of it.
